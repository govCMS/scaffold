        <p>The Sarlacc rests in the sandy well known as the Great Pit of Carkoon, buried except for its massive mouth and beaked tongue. The strange beast's lair was the site of many spectacles for Jabba the Hutt, who entertained himself by forcing prisoners into the creature's gaping tentacled maw.</p>
        <p>With his customized Mandalorian armor, deadly weaponry, and silent demeanor, Boba Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy. A genetic clone of his “father,” bounty hunter Jango Fett, Boba learned combat and martial skills from a young age. Over the course of his career, which included contracts for the Empire and the criminal underworld, he became a legend.</p>
        <p>Boba remained one of Jabba the Hutt’s most trusted enforcers, and was a fixture in the crime lord’s palace. During Luke Skywalker’s daring rescue of Han Solo above the Sarlacc, Boba tried to subdue the Jedi -- first with a grappling rope, then with blaster bolts. Before he could hit his target, however, Han accidentally slammed a pole into the bounty hunter’s jetpack. It ignited, sending Boba careening into the side of Jabba’s sail barge and tumbling into the man-eating pit.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The moon was covered in dense woodlands, tall mountains, and savannas, and home to the sentient Ewok, Dulok, and Yuzzum species. Some of Endor's trees reached more than 1,000 meters in height. It contained a breathable atmosphere to humans and 8% surface water. It also had two suns: Endor I and Endor II</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Throughout galactic history, offworld raiders occasionally came to Endor to hunt the native Ewok population to make Ewok Jerky, which was a popular snack across the Outer Rim.</p>
        <p>Sometime during the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Empire established an outpost on the moon that included a shield generator complex to protect the incomplete second Death Star in orbit of the moon. In order to make way for the complex, an Ewok village was razed by Imperial troops, leading to strained Imperial—Ewok relations.[17] As a result of the repulsorlift field emitted by the SLD-26 planetary shield generator to keep the Death Star in a stationary orbit, Endor was prone to earthquakes, tidal imbalances, and other geological disturbances.</p>
        <h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
        <p>The speeder bike chase was filmed at the Owen R. Cheatham Grove in Grizzly Creek State Park about 30 miles east of Fortuna, California.[23] Most of the other location scenes for Endor were filmed in Stout Grove, part of Jedidah Smith Redwods State Park, 5 miles east of Crescent City, California, near the Tolowa village Hiouchi. Scenes requiring explosions were shot on private logging company land in the vicinity because the trees were scheduled to be logged and the State Park would not allow damage to their trees.</p>
