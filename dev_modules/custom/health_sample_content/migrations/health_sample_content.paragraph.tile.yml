        Faster and better-armed descendents of regular TIE fighters, TIE interceptors defended the second Death Star at the Battle of Endor. The bent-winged fighters swarmed the Rebel fleet in a terrifying display of the Empire's military might.

        The TIE defender is an experimental fighter of the TIE series, armed with heavy cannons and shields, and is equipped with a hyperdrive. A major weapon for the Empire, the TIE defender proves much more difficult to destroy than standard TIE fighters.

        With its sleek arrowhead shape, streamlined cockpit, and massive twin engines, the A-wing starfighter suggests raw speed even when parked within Alliance hangar bays. Faster than even the TIE interceptor, the A-wing is well suited for lightning strikes.

      field_h_summary: |
        Perhaps the oddest-looking starfighter in the Rebel Alliance fleet, the B-wing fighter is as powerful as it is ungainly. The ship's structure is almost entirely taken up by its primary airfoil, which houses a cylindrical cockpit on one end, an engine cluster in the center, and a heavy weapons pod at its base.
