          Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. One of the largest and the most complete
          specimen, nicknamed Sue (FMNH PR2081), is located at the Field Museum of Natural History. Sue measured 12.8
          meters (42 ft) long,was 3.66 meters (12 ft) tall at the hips, and according to the most recent
          studies, using a variety of techniques, estimated to have weighed between 8.4 metric tons (9.3 short tons) to 14
          metric tons (15.4 short tons).

          A specimen nicknamed Scotty (RSM P2523.8), located at the Royal
          Saskatchewan Museum, is reported to measure 13 m (43 ft) in length. Using a mass estimation technique that
          extrapolates from the circumference of the femur, Scotty was estimated as the largest known specimen at 8.8
          metric tons (9.7 short tons) in weight

          The discovery of feathered dinosaurs led to debates if, and to what extent, Tyrannosaurus might have been
          feathered. Filamentous structures, which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers, have
          been reported in the small-bodied, basal tyrannosauroid Dilong paradoxus from the Early Cretaceous Yixian
          Formation of China in 2004. Because integumentary impressions of larger tyrannosauroids known at that time
          showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that insulating feathers might have
          been lost by larger species due to their smaller surface-to-volume ratio.

          The largest known Tyrannosaurus rex skull measures up to 1.52 meters (5 ft) in length. Large fenestrae
          (openings) in the skull reduced weight, as in all carnivorous theropods. In other respects Tyrannosaurus's skull
          was significantly different from those of large non-tyrannosaurid theropods.

        {{ render '@callout' }}

        <p>Teeth from what is now documented as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden,
          Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils
          were believed to be from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis, now Deinodon grandis) but are now
          considered Tyrannosaurus rex remains.</p>
